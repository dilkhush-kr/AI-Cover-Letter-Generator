## AI Prompts Used – Week 4 (Level 2)

During the development of this project, I used AI tools to understand concepts and improve my implementation, not to blindly copy code.

### Prompt 1
"Explain how to securely use an API key in a backend server using .env files and why it should not be exposed in frontend code."

### Prompt 2
"How to send a dynamic prompt to an AI API from a backend route using fetch and handle async responses properly?"

### Prompt 3
"My Gemini API sometimes returns different response formats. How can I safely parse the response without crashing the application?"

### Prompt 4
"Explain how to implement a loading state in a frontend application while waiting for an AI API response."
